		<h2 id="Working_with_the_Navigator_View">Working with the Navigator View</h2>
		<p>The R4E Navigator View is the main component of R4E. It shows all the information that is available to the user and it is also the place where most user commands are available. The Review Navigator information is organized in a hierarchical tree structure and is presented in a Navigator panel.  Elements shown in red are read-only. Commands are available in the view toolbar and in context menus that appear when right-clicking the navigator elements. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="ReviewNavigatorView.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>When a Review is open, the Navigator view can focus on and display the Review elements in an alternate display that show them in a more compact and table-like way.  Both representations can be toggled on by using the 
			<i>Change Display</i> toolbar command.
		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Disabling_and_Restoring_Elements">Disabling and Restoring Elements</h3>
		<p>When Review Navigator elements are not relevant anymore (e.g. completed reviews), they can be removed from the view by using the 
			<i>Disable </i>command from the element's context menu. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="DisableElement.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Disabled elements data is kept, but they will not appear in the navigator view anymore. Take note that currently it is not possible to completely remove references to an element once it is created. </p>
		<p>To see disabled elements in the Navigator view, go to the R4E Preferences Filter Tab and select the 
			<i>Show Disabled Elements</i> checkbox and apply the preferences. The disabled elements will show in the Navigator grayed out and with the little disabled decorator icon 
			<img border="0" src="Dsbldovr_tsk.gif"/> 
		</p>
		<p>Ideally, disabled elements should never be shown, but there could be a need to restore mistakenly disabled elements. To do so, first go to the Eclipse preferences R4E page, on the 
			<i>Filters</i> tab and enable the 
			<i>Show Disabled Elements</i> filter, then return to the Navigator view and select the 
			<i>Restore </i>command from the disabled element context menu 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="RestoreElement.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Sorting_Review_Navigator_Elements">Sorting Review Navigator Elements</h3>
		<p>The Navigator elements can currently be sorted alphabetically or by review type, by selecting the appropriate sorter in the Review Navigator Toolbar menu. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="Sorters.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Filtering_Review_Navigator_Elements">Filtering Review Navigator Elements</h3>
		<p>The Navigator view provides different filters that can be used to limit the visibility of elements within the navigator tree. Filters are available in the Review Navigator Toolbar menu. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="Filters.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>The filters available are: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>Show Reviews Only</i>: Show only Review Groups and Review elements 
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Show My Reviews</i>: Show only Review Groups and Review elements in which the current user is a Participant 
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Show Reviews for Participant...</i>: Opens a dialog box where a User ID can be specified. The Navigator will then show only Reviews in which this User is a Participant 
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Show My Assigned Elements</i>: Show review elements that are unassigned or assigned to the current User 
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Show Assigned Elements for Participant...</i>: Opens a dialog box where a User ID can be specified. The Navigator will then show only Review elements that are unassigned or assigned to the specified participant.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Show Unassigned Elements</i>: Show only review elements that are not currently assigned to any participant.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Show Anomalies Only</i>: Only show the Anomalies for the currently open Review and their parent containers 
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Show My Anomalies</i>: Only show the Anomalies for the currently open Review that the current User created and their parent containers 
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Hide Completed Reviews</i>: Hide all the reviews that are in phase 
				<i>COMPLETED</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Hide Reviewed Elements</i>: This filter will hide all elements that have been marked as Review by the current User 
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Hide Rule Sets</i>: This filter will hide all Rule Sets elements and their children 
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Hide Deltas</i>: This filter will hide all Selection and Delta elements. 
			</li>

				<i>Remove All Filters</i>: Remove all currently applied filters and restores the full display of all enabled elements in the Navigator tree.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br/>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Setting_Elements_Reviewed_State">Setting Elements Reviewed State</h3>
		<p>To help Users to keep track of the content that was reviewed it is possible to mark relevant Review Navigator elements as reviewed using the context menu Mark/Unmark as User Reviewed command. This will put a little done decorator 
			<img border="0" src="Revovr_tsk.gif"/> icon. The marking can be removed by using the same command to toggle the state. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Setting_Elements_Due_Date">Setting Elements Due Date</h3>
		<p>A due date can be set for the Review and Anomalies elements to specify a latest date after which the review (or anomaly) should be completed (i.e. set to a terminal state).  After this date has passed, if the elements are still not completed, they will be highlighted in the Review Navigator, using icon decorators, red text and additional info in their respective tooltips, so that the review participants are aware of the situation and can take action quickly.  Take note that does not apply to anomalies in basic reviews, since they are stateless.</p>
		<p>
			<br/>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Other_Review_Navigator_Commands">Other Review Navigator Commands</h3>
		<p>These other commands are also available from the Navigator view toolbar and/or drop-down menu: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>Progress Element</i> 
				<img border="0" src="nxtstate_menu.gif"/>: Change the state of a stateful element (e.g. Review, Anomaly) to its next logical state.  This is a shortcut and can also be done through the R4E Properties view for the element.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Regress Element</i> 
				<img border="0" src="prevstate_menu.gif"/>: Change the state of a stateful element (e.g. Review, Anomaly) to its previous logical state.  This is a shortcut and can also be done through the R4E Properties view for the element.  Take note that this is the only way to change the state of a 
				<i>COMPLETED</i> Review.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Go Into</i> 
				<img border="0" src="Focus_menu.gif"/>: This is a special filter that will take the selected element of the Navigator and put it at the root of the Navigator tree. This is useful to focus on a particular element and its children.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Collapse Navigator tree</i> 
				<img border="0" src="Clpseall_menu.gif"/>: Collapse the current Navigator tree.
			</li>

		<h2 id="Handling_Review_Groups_and_Reviews">Handling Review Groups and Reviews</h2>
		<h3 id="Creating_a_Review_Group">Creating a Review Group</h3>
		<p>When using R4E for the first time, the first thing to do is to create Review Groups that will hold the R4E review data. Typically, Review Groups include common settings that will be used for multiple reviews. For instance, one can create a Review Group for a design organization, for a given project or task etc. </p>
		<p>A given Review Groups is created only once, typically by a "super-user" selected among people that are part of the group. </p>
		<p>In order to create the Group, select the 
			<i>New Group</i> icon in the Review Navigator Toolbar. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="NewReviewGroup.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>This opens the New Review Group dialog. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="NewReviewGroupDialog.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Add the Review Group Name and (optionally) a brief description in the appropriate text fields. </li>
			<li>Select a shared folder location where team members have access and write permissions (i.e. Review Group shared folder) </li>
			<li>Under the Extra Parameters section, more information can optionally be entered to further characterize the Group: Default Project, Default Components and Default Entry Criteria values will be available for all Reviews created under this Review Group. Rule Sets defines the available Rule Sets for Review created under this Review Group (see Rule Sets below).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Opening_an_Existing_Review_Group">Opening an Existing Review Group</h3>
		<p>When you create a new Review Group, its references are automatically included in your workspace. To add other Review Group references, open the R4E Preference Group Tab (Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;R4E, then switch to tab "Groups")</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="R4E_preferences_general_groups.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Add a new Review Group reference file by clicking the 
				<i>Add </i>button and select the appropriate Group File. Take note that all Review Group filename end with "_group_root.xrer" suffix. 
			</li>
			<li>The Review Group Name and Description are also shown in the Preferences Group tab.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br/>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Creating_a_Review">Creating a Review</h3>
		<p>The Review is the main element of R4E. It is used to group together file that are to be reviewed. There are three type of reviews, Basic, Informal and Formal review (See concepts section for an explanation of the different types of reviews). </p>
		<p>To create a new Review, right-click on the parent Review Group under which you want to create the review and select the 
			<i>New Review</i> Command from the R4E Context Menu. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="NewReview.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>This opens the New Review dialog. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="NewReviewDialog.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Add the Review Name and a brief description in the appropriate text fields. </li>
			<li>Under the Extra Parameters section, more information can optionally be entered to further characterize the Review: 
				<ul>
					<li>A due date can be set to specify a date before which the review should be completed</li>
					<li>Project and Components values can be selected from the values entered in the parent Review Group Default Projects and Default Components respectively </li>
					<li>Entry Criteria is taken by default from the parent Review Group value </li>
					<li>Objectives and Reference Materials can be set by the Review creator</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Opening_and_Closing_of_Review_Groups_and_Reviews">Opening and Closing of Review Groups and Reviews</h3>
		<p>In order to be able to see the Review Group child Reviews, a Review Group must be open. Closed Review Group are shown with hollow Group icons. You can open a closed Review Group by right-clicking on it and selecting the 
			<i>Open Element</i> command, or simply by double-clicking on it. &nbsp;Closing unused Review Groups make navigation easier and free up memory and resources, so the Groups should be closed when they are unused. 
		</p>
		<p>Likewise, reviews can also be open and closed using the same mechanism. The only difference is that only one review (called the Active Review) can be open at any given time. Opening another Review closes the currently open one. </p>
		<p>Take note that Review Groups and Reviews are automatically open after they are first created. </p>
		<p>
			<br/>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Adding_Participants_to_a_Review">Adding Participants to a Review</h3>
		<p>Participants are automatically added to the current Review as soon as they add review items to it or create an anomaly. It is also possible to add them manually. </p>
		<p>To do so, right click on the parent review and select the 
			<i>New Participants</i> Command from the R4E Context Menu. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="NewParticipant.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>This opens the 
			<i>Enter Participants details</i> dialog. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="NewParticipantDialog.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>The dialog is divided into 2 sections:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Participants:  This is where the participants are added.  Use the field above to enter the IDs on the participants to add, separated by semicolons (;).  If you defined Participants Lists in the preferences, the list name can be added here.  Once the participants are entered, hit the return key, or use the 
				<i>Add</i> button to add them to the list of participants.  The participants will now appear in the participants list just below.  If present, participants lists from Preferences are resolved and their contents is added to the list as well.  If an LDAP database is setup up and configured in the preferences, R4E will also try to resolve the added users and automatically fetch the information from the database.  Participants can be removed from the list by using the 
				<i>Erase</i> button, and the list can be reset by using the 
				<i>Clear</i> button.  If an LDAP database is set up, it can also be accessed using the 
				<i>Find</i> button (see below).  The participant id entered within the R4E review data will be in lower case and R4E will enforce that (this to prevent duplicated users Ids for the same user).
			</li>
			<li>Basic Parameters:  Once participants are added to the participants list.  This section displays the basic information for the currently selected entry in the list.  The email address can be edited, but not the Id or the participant details field (which in only filled if an LDAP database is set up and there is information about the user in it).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>If an LDAP database is configured and connected, the user information could be searched and filled-in automatically using the 
			<i>Find</i> button, which will open the Find User Dialog 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="FindUserDialog.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Any field can be entered in the Search Filters section and by clicking the Search button, an LDAP query will be sent to the database. If any matches are found, the results will be displayed in the Query Results section.   Once the results are in, users can be added by double-clicking on them in the results table, or by selecting them and using the 
			<i>Add Users</i> button.  Pressing the 
			<i>OK</i> button will result in the users being added to the New Participants dialog participant list.
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Creating_a_Review_Item">Creating a Review Item</h3>
		<p>In R4E, Review Items are a collection of one or more files, or parts of files, that are to be reviewed. There are two types of Review Items that exist: Commit Review Items and Resource Review Items. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h4 id="Creating_a_Resource_Review_Item">Creating a Resource Review Item</h4>
		<p>This item type is created by manually selecting a workspace resource (i.e. File) or a portion of a resource (i.e. line ranges within a given file). </p>
		<ul>
			<li>To create Resource review items for a whole file, right-click a File on a Package Explorer, Navigator or Project View and select the 
				<i>Add Review Item</i> command from the R4E context menu.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="AddResourceReviewItemFile.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To create Resource review items for a portion of a file, right click a line range selection in an editor or compare editor, or on an element of the outline view and select the 
				<i>Add Review Item</i> command from the R4E context menu.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="AddResourceReviewItemRange.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Once a Resource Review Item is created, it will be shown in the Review Navigator. If you expand the Review Item, you will see the child elements: The file on which the Review Item is applied and the line range selection that is part of the item. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="ResourceReviewItem.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h4 id="Creating_a_Commit_Review_Item">Creating a Commit Review Item</h4>
		<p>This item type is created by selecting files that were committed to a Version Control System repository. Currently, the only Version Control System supported is Git. </p>
		<p>To create a Commit Review Item, right click on a project attached to the Egit team provider (see Project Configuration) and select the 
			<i>Find Review Items</i> command from the R4E Context menu. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="FindReviewItems.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>This will show the Version Control System Commit Dialog (Here shown for the Git connector). </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="FindReviewItemsDialog.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Use the 
			<i>Available Commits</i> combo box to browse through all available commits and select one. For the selected commit, the commit information and affected files appear in the Commit Information and Committed Components sections respectively. 
		</p>
		<p>Once a Commit Review Item is created, it will be shown in the Review Navigator. If you expand the Review Item, you will see the child elements: The file on which the Review Item is applied and, optionally if the option is selected in the preferences, the line ranges for the Deltas (or differences between the committed file and its direct ancestor) that are part of the Item. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="CommitReviewItem.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>The icons for the files that are new and were added in the commit will be shown decorated with a little 
			<img border="0" src="Addovr_tsk.png"/> icon The icons for the files that were removed in the commit will be shown decorated with a little 
			<img border="0" src="Removr_tsk.png"/> icon Files in the commit that are out of sync i.e. for which the version to review and the version present in the users workspace differ will be shown with the &gt; sign prepended to the filename. Such files can be reviewed, but to use the full navigatability provided by the editors, it is strongly recommended that the files be in sync with the workspace whenever possible. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Assigning_Review_Elements">Assigning Review Elements</h3>
		<p>It is possible to assign specific review  elements (i.e. Review Items, File Contexts, Selections and Deltas) to specific participants.  To do so, use the context command 
			<i>Assign to Participant</i> for the desired elements.  
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="AssignParticipant.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>To remove an assignment, use the context command 
			<i>Unassign Participant</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="UnassignParticipant.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Take note that if a parent is assigned to given participants, then all its children will also be assigned.  It is possible to override the parent's values and to change the children's assignments by operating on the child element directly.</p>
		<p>Assignments can also be managed by using the Properties view for the selected element.</p>
		<h3 id="Creating_an_Anomaly">Creating an Anomaly</h3>
		<p>R4E Anomalies are raised by reviewers to flag problems or add comments on specific parts of the contents as part of the review process. </p>
		<p>Anomalies are added in a similar way Resource Review Items are, either from a selected Resource or from a portion/range of a resource, by selecting the 
			<i>Add Anomaly</i> command from the R4E context menu. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="NewAnomaly.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Anomalies that are directly tied to a specific selection/delta range can also be created by selecting the 
			<i>Add Linked Anomaly</i> command from the context menu of the affected selection/delta in the Review Navigation View 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="NewLinkedAnomaly.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Anomalies can also be created at the review level. This is useful to flag problems that are not specifically tied to a given file or file part. To do this, use the 
			<i>Add Anomaly</i> Command from the context menu of the Global Anomalies element in the Review Navigator view. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="NewGlobalAnomaly.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>This opens the New Anomaly dialog. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="NewAnomalyDialog.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Add the Anomaly Title and Description in the appropriate text fields. </li>
			<li>Under the Extra Parameters section, you can also specify the class, rank, due date and participant that will be assigned to this anomaly.  If Rule Sets are associated to the parent Review Group, the Rule Sets hierarchy will be shown and, optionally, a design rule can be toggled selected/de-selected and if selected its values will be applied to this anomaly. This will override the previous Anomaly values.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Cloning_an_existing_Anomaly">Cloning an existing Anomaly</h3>
		<p>Anomalies can be duplicated so that their information is applied to a new location and/or file.  Anomalies are cloned be selecting a new range in an editor and using the 
			<i>Clone Anomaly</i> contextual command
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="CloneAnomaly.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>This will trigger the Clone Anomaly Dialog, where the source anomaly to clone can be selected.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="CloneAnomalyDialog.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Once this is done, a new Anomaly will appear at the new location with the same information as the source one.</p>
		<p>Anomalies can also be cloned to a specific Delta or Selection element by dragging and dropping them over the desired Delta or Selection, by using the Copy and Paste Review Navigator Contextual commands or by using the generic Copy (CTRL+C) and Paste (CTRL+V) hotkeys.  </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="DragDropAnomaly.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="CopyAnomaly.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="PasteAnomaly.png"/>
		</p>

		<h3 id="Creating_Comments_on_an_existing_Anomaly">Creating Comments on an existing Anomaly</h3>
		<p>It is possible to add comments to an existing anomaly. This could be useful in discussing the anomaly or for tracking purposes. To create a Comment, use the

		<h3 id="Cloning_existing_Comments_to_an_Anomaly">Cloning existing Comments to an Anomaly</h3>
		<p>As for anomalies, it is also possible to copy comment information to another anomaly.  It is done in a similar way than for cloning anomalies, by dragging and dropping the source comment(s) unto the target anomaly, by using the Copy and Paste Review Navigator contextual commands or by using the generic Copy (CTRL+C) and Paste (CTRL+V) hotkeys</p>

		<h3 id="Importing_Postponed_Anomalies">Importing Postponed Anomalies</h3>
		<p>Postponed Anomalies are Anomalies that were written in previous Informal/Formal Reviews, but were not handled then and were instead set to 
			<i>POSTPONED</i> state.  If the current Review include files on which these anomalies were written, whether it is the same or a different version of a file, it is possible to import them in the current review so that they can be addressed.  Currently, only Postponed Anomalies that belong to Reviews under the same Review Group can be imported. Global Anomalies that were written in other Reviews in the same Review Group can also optionally be imported.
		</p>
		<p>To import Postponed Anomalies, just select the current Review in the Navigator View and use the context menu:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="ImportAnomalies.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>R4E will scan all Reviews under the current Review Group and will copy all Anomalies in 
			<i>POSTPONED</i> state that were written on files also included in the current Review, and also Global Anomalies in 
			<i>POSTPONED</i> state written in other Reviews, if the option is selected in the preferences.  Once the command is done, the imported elements will appear on their own container elements under the Review element in the Review Navigator tree.
		</p>
		<p>From then on, Postponed anomalies will behave like any other Anomaly and can be handled in the same way.  All changes except the state changes will be local to the imported anomaly i.e. changing the imported anomaly will not change the original one.  When a Postponed Anomaly is modified, the state changes will also be reflected in the original Anomaly (i.e. the one filed in the previous Review).  For instance if the imported anomaly is fixed, the original one will be marked as fixed to convey the fact that the postponed issue is now closed. </p>
		<p>Take note that Postponed Anomalies that have their state changed from POSTPONED will be disabled.  If they are set back to Postponed, they will be restored as Postponed elements.</p>
		<p>Postponed Anomalies will not be imported/refreshed from Reviews that have non-compatible metadata (Prefixed by the Unknown Tag).  Likewise, it is not possible to alter a Postponed Anomaly if its original Review have non-compatible metadata without first upgrading it to the current metadata version (See 
			<a href="_r4eOpenUser.html#Version_Compatibility">Version Compatibility</a> for more details on version compatibility)

		<p>Files can be open in editors by double-clicking on them or their children in the Review Navigator. By default, files belonging to resource review items will be open in single-file editors, whereas files belonging to commit review items will be open in a compare editor. If the file is open using the child Selection/Delta/Anomaly element, then the cursor will automatically be positioned to the start of the line range that corresponds to the element. Files and also be open in the single-file editor by using the

		<h2 id="Using_Notifications">Using Notifications</h2>
		<p>R4E support sending Meeting and E-mail notifications directly from the Eclipse workbench. Notification send are pre-filled with all the relevant information, making it easy to have standardized communication between the Review participants. </p>
		<p>Meeting notifications also can be used to schedule various meetings (e.g. decision meetings) automatically. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Using_Email_Notifications">Using Email Notifications</h3>
		<p>E-mail notification can be sent on Review Navigator elements by using the 
			<i>Send Email/Notification</i> command from the selected element context menu. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="SendEmail.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Once the command is triggered, a dialog appears asking the kind of notification to be sent. Take note that not all the options are available depending on the element selected, the review type and other factors. </p>
		<p>
			<br/>

		<h5 id="List_of_Anomalies">List of Anomalies</h5>
		<p>This section is only available for the inspection record. The list of anomalies raised during the review with the following information:
			File Name, line range, tile of the anomaly, class, ranking and the due date.</p>
		<h2 id="Performing_Reviews">Performing Reviews</h2>
		<h3 id="Performing_Basic_Reviews">Performing Basic Reviews</h3>
		<p>In R4E, basic reviews are the simplest form of reviews available. Basic reviews are stateless and the anomalies that are raised are also stateless. This means the participants must track progress of the Review and of the raised Anomaly externally. </p>
		<p>Typically, the workflow of a basic review will go as follows: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Review is created </li>
			<li>Review Items are added, either by manually selecting resources or by automatically selecting files committed using the Find Review Items command on the target project .</li>
			<li>Optionally, review elements are assigned to specific participants.</li>
			<li>Organizer/Lead notifies reviewers that the items are ready for review. his can be done externally or by using the Email notification functionality provided by R4E </li>
			<li>Reviewers review their items and raise anomalies as they encounter them. </li>
			<li>At any time there could be communication between the reviewers and the authors of the code under review. Since there is no anomaly state tracking, they will have to agree on how to handle the anomalies raised. </li>
			<li>Once all the reviewers are done and the anomalies are fixed, the review can be set as completed.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Performing_Informal_Reviews">Performing Informal Reviews</h3>
		<p>Informal Review workflow is pretty much the same as the Basic Review workflow, so the steps described above still apply. However, the main difference is the fact that anomalies are now stateful and they need to be addressed/resolved before the review can be closed. </p>
		<p>The state diagram for the anomaly workflow is as follows: </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="InformalAnomalyStates.png"/> 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Assigned: This is the state set when the anomalies are created. This is the only non-terminal state </li>
			<li>Deferred: The Anomaly will is valid but will not be fixed now, but at a later time </li>
			<li>Duplicated: The Anomaly is a duplicate of another one </li>
			<li>Rejected: The Anomaly is invalid and will not be fixed </li>
			<li>Fixed: The Anomaly is valid and was fixed. This is normally a terminal state, unless the Review Exit Decision is set to Accepted with Follow-up, in which case the Verified state is the terminal one. </li>
			<li>Verified: The Anomaly was fixed and verified by the participant that raised it. This state is normally optional, but all Anomalies that are fixed should be subsequently set to verified is the Review Exit Decision is set to Accepted with Follow-up.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Once all the Anomalies are in a terminal state, the review can then be closed as it is done for Basic Reviews. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Performing_Formal_Reviews">Performing Formal Reviews</h3>
		<p>Formal Review follow the IEEE 1028-1997 standard. They are stateful and divided into Review Phases. As in Informal Reviews, anomalies created are also stateful. </p>
		<p>The state diagram for Formal review workflow is as follows: </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="FormalReviewStates.png"/> 
		</p>
		<h4 id="Planning_Phase_2">Planning Phase</h4>
		<p>The Planning phase is the active phase when the review is initially created. In this phase, the Review Organizer and/or Lead adds the contents that is to be reviewed, either manually or by selecting items from the Version Control System and adds participant that will be part of the review. Optionally, review elements are assigned to specific participants.  At the end of this phase, a notification is sent to the participant that the items are ready to be reviewed, and an invitation to a decision meeting set-up by the Organizer/Lead. Once this phase is completed, it is impossible to go back to it. </p>
		<h4 id="Preparation_Phase_2">Preparation Phase</h4>
		<p>The Preparation phase is the phase where participants review the items included in the review and potentially raise anomalies. Once all reviewers have completed their tasks (and notified the Organizer/Lead), then the review can progress to the next phase. </p>
		<h4 id="Decision_Phase_2">Decision Phase</h4>
		<p>The Decision phase is where all the anomalies that were logged are analyzed and a decision is made on each of them on how to handle them. Potential outcomes include fixing the problem flagged by the anomaly, deferring it, or rejecting it if it is not valid. Once all the Anomalies are examined, a decision can be taken on how to close the review. The possible outcomes for the review at this stage is that it could be rejected and more reviewing/rework is necessary, it could be accepted as is, or it could be conditionally accepted, provided that the outstanding anomalies are fixed. </p>
		<h4 id="Rework_Phase_2">Rework Phase</h4>
		<p>The Rework phase is an optional phase, only used when a review is conditionally accepted, in which valid anomalies are fixed. Once the fixed are included, the anomalies will need to be re-checked to verify that the fixes are acceptable. When all the fixes are verified, the Review can be completed. </p>
		<h4 id="Other_Considerations">Other Considerations</h4>
		<p>Take note that there is a slight difference between the anomaly states in Informal Reviews and the ones used in Formal Reviews, as it can be seen below: </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="FormalAnomalyStates.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>A new Anomaly in a Formal Review is set to 
			<i>CREATED </i>by default. During the decision phase, it could be set to the same values as in Informal Reviews, and it can also be set to 
			<i>ACCEPTED</i>, which means that the anomaly is deemed valid and will be handled and fixed. There is no 
			<i>ASSIGNED </i>state for Anomalies in Formal Reviews. The rest of the anomaly flow is essentially the same as with Informal Reviews.
