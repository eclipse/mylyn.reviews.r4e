= Installing R4E =

== 1) Provision Software Sites ==

R4E uses some Mylyn components so you will need to add the Mylyn Release update site.

Add the following Software Sites to the Eclipse workspace (Help -> Install New Software -> Add)

Mylyn Release: http://download.eclipse.org/mylyn/releases/latest 

Mylyn Reviews R4E Updates: http://download.eclipse.org/r4e/updates/ 

if Subversion is to be used, add the subclipse site of the subclipse version you want to use e.g. http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x
<br>

== 2) Install Version Control System Features ==

R4E uses Mylyn Versions to interact with different version control systems.
* Git: 
:Git support is provided by interfacing with Egit/Jgit, 
:Installing the R4E feature automatically installs Egit/Jgit if it's not yet available in the Eclipse installation.
:So no specific action is needed for Egit installation in this step.

* Subversion (SVN): 
:If there is a need to interact with an SVN repository, install the subclipse feature.
:Help -> Install New Software, and select the subclipse site provisioned above.<br>
